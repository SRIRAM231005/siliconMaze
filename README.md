hi my name is B.Sriram the points to be noted is if the output doesn't appear properly the please reload until you get hte desired output no problem in the code but it takes some time to get the data from the API and meanwhile it prints either half of the output or 
wrong output the right output should have moves of first pokemon then moves of second pokemon and then atlast the winner
